# Project Misty 🌫️  
A samurai-inspired 2D pixel fighting game in development — imagine *Pixel Samurai* meets *Katana Zero*.  
Developed FULLY in Java, with a focus on tight combat mechanics, dynamic UI, and stylized visuals.

## 🎮 Game Overview  
This is a fighting game concept/idea based on classic 2D samurai games, with elements from modern action titles like Sekiro. The goal is to create a fluid, reactive combat system and a full arcade/story experience, eventually adding multiplayer, bosses, and multiple maps.
